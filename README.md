Figure 1. Graphical abstract: Cohorts A/B combined into C with QC and TOPMed imputation; PCA (15 PCs), K-means/PAM clustering with bootstrap; key outcomes include improved reproducibility when combining clinical and genetic features, HLA-driven signal (rs9271351), and significant HLA SNP×SNP interactions.
Abstract
Objective: To test whether integrating genotype and clinical variables yields reproducible subclusters among individuals with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D).

Methods: We curated two independent cohorts (A: n=129; B: n=205, 5 removed after QC) and merged them into cohort C (n=329). Genotypes were QC’d, TOPMed-imputed, harmonized, and pruned to 40 high-quality GWAS-indexed SNPs common to A/B/C. We computed PCA (15 PCs) and performed clustering under three feature sets: genetic-only; genetic+age/sex; and genetic+full clinical. We evaluated bootstrap stability up to 3000 resamples and measured partition concordance via Adjusted Rand Index (ARI). We then assessed HLA-region enrichment and SNP–SNP interactions.

Results: Across A/B/C, a 2-cluster structure consistently emerged, with higher stability when combining clinical and genetic features compared with either alone. HLA class II variants — notably rs9271351 — were overrepresented. In cohort C, we detected a significant interaction between rs9469200 and rs2395228. Clinical-only clustering exhibited weaker stability, whereas clinical+genetic achieved reproducible partitions.

Conclusions: Integrating clinical and genetic information increases cluster reproducibility and reveals HLA-driven structure and SNP interactions not apparent from either modality alone.
